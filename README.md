# Flaskr Plus

### Author: 张慎卿｜Zhang Sheniqng

This update to the base application includes following: 

- Add the ability to assign a user-provided category to each post, and display each post's category underneath its title.  

- Add the ability to filter posts by category, so you only see posts of the chosen category.  The user should not have to know what categories are available; they should be able to select one from a list. It also includes a way to return to seeing all of the posts after filtering.

- Add the ability to delete individual posts with a button attached to each post.
